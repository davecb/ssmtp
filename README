Purpose and value:
  This is sSMTP, a program that replaces sendmail on workstations that
should send their mail via the departmental mailhub from which they pick up
their mail (via pop, imap, rsmtp, pop_fetch, NFS... or the like).  This
program accepts mail and sends it to the mailhub, optionally replacing the
domain in the From: line with a different one.

  WARNING: the above is all it does. It does not receive mail, expand aliases
or manage a queue.  That belongs on a mailhub with a system administrator.
The man page (ssmtp.8) and the program logic manual (ssmtp_plm) discuss the
limitations in more detail.

  It uses a minimum of external configuration information, and so can be
installed by copying the (right!) binary and an optional four-line config
file to a given machine. 

Type of systems supported:
  Berkeley-derived, or ones otherwise using /user/lib/sendmail as a
mail transfer agent.
  In use on SunOS 4.1.1, NextStep 2.x/3 and Ultrix 4.2, tested briefly on AIX
3.2 and RISCos.  Tested by others on DG U/X 5 and SVR4.

Dependencies:
  External: Berkeley sockets and supporting libraries.

Known limitations:
  This is not a complete sendmail.  It is only a program to post
mail to a mailhub for people who don't **want** a complete sendmail.
