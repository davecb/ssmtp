Summary of Reviews

In summary i found the tool to be well packaged and very portable.
HPUX is as unique as other *nix's and this compiled and built
pretty much out of the box.  The man page was missing, a detail
in this dist'n for review.

Conceptually the idea is timely and of use in many situations.
Sharing resources in a workgroup is not a strong point for Unix.
ssmtp provides a nice bit of simplification for the touchy issue
of mail addressing and handling in this situation.

`Post it with notes about HPUX.'

Systems [UNIX, with sockets]:
	HPUX 8.0
	SunOS 4.1.3

	[needs sockets -- so does sendmail, BTW.]

Format of the Submission			[!!]
	Shar file.  Unpacks in the current directory.

	Missing the man page?

General:

The README is mercifully short and concise.  It also points to the larger
_plm doc for complete design info.  The _plm file is a very good idea and i
will be copying the format for my own stuff!

Building the Software

The only issue I have here is that "tcov" is not described.  I get the
impression that anyone on a SUN will know what it is right away, but us
"furriners" from HP-land get lost about here.  I think a note in the INSTALL
and in the makefile is called for.  You might also want to change the "tcov"
item in the Makefile to "test" as a more generic title.

Of course the `tcov' version of the tool did not build correctly.

NO for install - HP's std install command stalled and died on the install
step.  I would recommend at least a note telling HPUX users to run the
make install as root and to change install to "cp".


Testing the Software

[Did the software run on each of the systems you tested?]

well no, but it is not ssmtp's fault.  We may not have the mailhubs
sendmail configured in a std way.  I am one of the sysops here and I
will be following up on this.  when sending to the hub I get:
> /usr/lib/sendmail nobody <test.mail
/usr/lib/sendmail: can't open the smtp port (25) on nbrwh83.bnr.ca.
... so something is wrong.

[Did the program perform the functions it was supposed to perform?]

The test_ssmtp shows that the code runs safely, all options it does not
handle are warned about.  It does not wreck any thing.  
And I will get the hub to listen and I am sure that it will work.

I am not going to bother with diff's, too few changes:
	For HPUX 8.0

Makefile:LACKING= -DNOSTRNCASECMP
Makefile:ROOT=
Makefile:TFLAGS= ${BASEFLAGS}  #removed the -a
Makefile:        install -s -m 755 ssmtp ${DESTDIR}/sendmail
	to:	 cp ssmtp ${DESTDIR}/sendmail

ssmtp.c:        /* commented out for HPUX, the decl here clashes with the
		one in string_ext.c
		char    *strncasecmp();
		*/

Plus add to INSTALL:

"For installation on an HPUX cluster it is safest to make /usr/lib/sendfile
 a CDF so that only your node changes over to ssmtp.  If the sysops want to
 make it the general tool for the whole cluster they can make it so.

 Make the cdf by "makecdf -c default sendfile" in /usr/lib.
 Copy ssmtp to /usr/lib
 Add ssmtp to the cdf with "makecdf -c <yournode> -f ssmtp sendfile"
"

that is it for installing on an HPUX cluster.
None of this applies to HPUX stand-alone nodes.

The Documentation

	Cool.


Functionality and Features

[Does the software perform some function that is valuable?]

YES, we have problems in out HP cluster setup with sendmail on the
cluster nodes having a hardtime with the sendmail on the cluster
server.  I am hoping this little guy will sidestep the whole
issue, once I get it talking to the mail socket on the hub!

[Are there obvious features or additions that would improve the package?]

NOTHING - it is a clean, Unix-like little tool that does a small
job in a special situation.  Don't mess that up.
